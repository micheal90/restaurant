# resturant_app

### The application automates the ordering process by the customer inside the restaurant by browsing and ordering what he wants through his account and then submitting it by the team responsible for the service.
The application consists of three types of users, customers, employees, and admin.
I'm use (Backend Firebase, Cloud Messaging, Firebase Authentication, GetX state management, Dio).
